# Final_Project

My SI 206 (Data-Oriented Programming) final project, completed with Ashley Newman, investigated correlations between the average happiness ratings of people within cities across the U.S. and average weather of these cities. In essence, our analysis focused on if people living in cities with better weather conditions (warmer temperatures, less precipitation) reported to be happier, on average. In this project, we gained experience in using API's, web-scraping, SQL-Lite database management, and data visualization with the Matplotlib library.
